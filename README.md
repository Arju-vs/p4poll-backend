Here, we provides the details about the P4Poll, polling app's description!
First of all , Its great experience to work with NextJs , as a normal nodejs developer , its the first time am working with nodeJs 's framework(NestJs).Its a lesson to understand about it and I guess I did it well,Its the first time right! If I did anything unwanted kindly tell my mistakes. 

I used AI tool for the understanding and how the nestjs mechanisms, I used chatGPT AI tool. By using that I got an idea how its working, I have the knowledge of creating MVC with nodeJs , so by using the AI tool, how the structure of the NestJS controllers, by using it I learnt how to build modules, services, controllers in NestJs, Its great , I am excited to work more projects with this to learn much more things in nestjs, gain experience in this and grow together with Jiitak.
